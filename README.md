# SNotes-cli

### Do you want an easy way to store and retrieve your credentials directly on the terminal?
### SNotes is a really simple command line tool that lets you do exactly that!

### Why is SNotes great?
- No need to remember multiple credentials, just set a master password and you won't need to worry remembering all those server and databases credentials anymore!
- Create/update/delete notes and passwords and store them locally using protobuf so you can use them in another project with another language if you want!
- Encrypt your notes and passwords with military grade security (AES)
- Get your data directly to your clipboard
- The master password can be stored locally with keyring so you don't have to enter your password constantly, the cached password will be deleted in the configured time. You can also choose to never store it in keyring

<h1>Terminal N</h1>

<p>Do you want an easy way to store and retrieve your credentials directly from the terminal?</p>
<p>NTerminal is a really simple command line tool that lets you create/update/delete notes and passwords, passwords are encrypted with AES using a master password so you dont need to remember all those postgresql, mongodb, server and other command line credentials. Once you select a password or note you'll get a prompt to copy the text straight to your clipboard. Storing notes and passwords has never been this easy</p>
